Welcome to my technical blog where I document everything I learn about cybersecurity, from networking fundamentals to offensive security, tools, and techniques. My goal is to write concise, technical breakdowns of problems I’ve solved, tools I’ve explored, and concepts I’ve demystified.

I use this space to:
- Write walk-throughs of challenges and CTFs
- Share insights from my research
- Publish notes that I wish I had when learning

**Expect raw, real, and useful technical content.**
