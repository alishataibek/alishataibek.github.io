## About Me

Hi, I'm Alisha Taibek — a passionate learner, tech enthusiast, and someone who enjoys creating things that make a difference. I'm currently exploring fields like cybersecurity and AI, through gaining knowledge and applying it practically. 

This blog is a space where I’ll be documenting my projects, sharing thoughts on tech, and reflecting on the learning process. It’s meant to be both a journal and a resource for anyone who might be walking a similar path.

## What This Blog Is For

- Sharing personal updates and project documentations
- Tutorials or notes from what I’m learning
