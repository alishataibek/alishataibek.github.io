## A Cybersecurity Roadmap: from basics to mastery

Despite having done an entire year of courses in university for cybersecurity, I was still lacking a lot of knowledge that could ground me in this field. Understanding that jumping into advanced topics wouldn't cut it, I found the [Ultimate Cybersecurity Roadmap](https://github.com/Hamed233/Cybersecurity-Mastery-Roadmap) that would set the tone to my journey, from complete basics to expertise.

### What does the Roadmap offer?

Created by [Hamed Esam](https://hamedesam.info/), the roadmap has 5 phases:
- ***Foundation Phase:*** core knowledge in computing, networking, and basics of security principles
- ***Technical Skills Phase:*** practical security skills
- ***Specialization Phase:*** offensive and defensive security specializations
- ***Advanced Phase:*** advanced topics and specialized security domains
- ***Professional Development:*** continuing education and career advancements

Each phase has several topics to cover, with each topic being accompanied by recommended resources, practical exercises, and tools to continue exploring. 

### What Now? 

I am still early in the journey - I make mistakes, get stuck a lot, and had to Google so many things. But that's part of the process! I will be sharing my progress, adding links to blog posts and tools I've tried, what worked, and what didn't.
